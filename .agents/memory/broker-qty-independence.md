name: Broker-independent quantity architecture
description: Delta Exchange (contracts/coin) and cTrader (lots) order-quantity systems must never share code paths, fallback defaults, or math
---

Delta Exchange and cTrader use fundamentally different quantity models:
- cTrader: lots, with `minVolumeLots`/`maxVolumeLots`/`stepVolumeLots`/`lotSizeNum` from ProtoOA.
- Delta: whole integer contracts, displayed either as a coin amount (contractValue < 1, e.g. "0.001 BTC")
  or a raw contract count (contractValue >= 1, e.g. "100 Contracts"), from Delta REST metadata
  (`contract_value`, `tick_size`, `position_size_limit`).

**Why:** The original bug was UI code that hardcoded `?? 0.01`, `?? 500`, `?? 0.01` fallbacks
for lot fields. Since Delta's lot fields are always null, every Delta symbol silently rendered
lot-based UI (wrong units, wrong precision, wrong step) instead of failing loudly or using
Delta's own metadata.

**How to apply:** Any UI or calc code touching order quantity must branch explicitly on the
resolved broker (`resolveBroker()` / `activeAccount.broker_id`) into two fully separate code
paths — one reading only `deltaQty` (a `DeltaQtySpec`), one reading only lot fields (a `LotSpec`).
Never fall back from one broker's spec to the other's defaults. Switching broker/symbol must
reset quantity state to the new broker's own minimum, not carry over the previous value.

Relevant files: `artifacts/trading-journal/src/lib/deltaMath.ts` (Delta-only pure math, mirrors
`lotMath.ts`'s cTrader-only pure math), `PlaceOrderPanel.tsx` (desktop) and
`MobileChartLayout.tsx` (mobile) both implement this branch pattern for quantity
input/validation/calc/submit. Backend: `contract_info.ts` has `buildDeltaSpec` (Delta REST) and
`buildCtraderSpec` (ProtoOA) as separate builders; `BrokerContractSpec.deltaQty` is null for
cTrader and populated only for Delta.
